Google Voice Growler
====================

Google Voice Growler is a userscript for [Google Voice](http://google.com/voice) running in
[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com) that checks for new items (SMS, voicemail, and missed calls)
and updates Growl & the [Dock badge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/malabooboo/3724142785/) when new items are found.
